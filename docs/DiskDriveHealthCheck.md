# DiskDriveHealthCheck

This health check monitors the amount of available free space on disk. If a disk's available free space is below `WarnGigabytes`, results will have a status of `Warn`. If below `FailGigabytes`, results will have a status of `Fail`.

None of its constructor's parameters are required.
